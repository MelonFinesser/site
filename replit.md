- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)

1. **SEO Services**: Website optimization quotes requiring existing website URLs
2. **Custom Design**: Fully custom website design with detailed requirements
3. **Business Websites**: E-commerce ready business websites with payment integration

### Form Validation
- Uses Zod schemas for runtime type safety and validation
- Shared schema definitions between client and server
- Type-safe form handling with React Hook Form

### Email Integration
- Automated email notifications for new quote submissions
- Customized email templates for different service types
- Environment-based email configuration for development/production

### UI/UX Features
- Responsive design optimized for all device sizes
- Smooth scrolling navigation between sections
- Tab-based quote forms with service-specific fields
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Loading states and error handling

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users navigate the marketing site and select a service type
2. **Form Submission**: Quote forms capture service-specific requirements
3. **Validation**: Client-side validation with Zod schemas before submission
4. **API Processing**: Express server validates and stores submissions in PostgreSQL
5. **Email Notification**: Automated emails sent to business for follow-up
6. **Storage**: All submissions stored with timestamps for tracking and analysis
